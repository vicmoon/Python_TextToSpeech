Lena had always dreamed of seeing the northern lights. As a child, she would press her nose against frost-covered windows, imagining the sky ablaze with swirling colors. Life, however, had a way of turning dreams into distant echoes. Work, responsibilities, and the steady march of time kept her grounded in the city.

One winter, she decided enough was enough. She booked a last-minute trip to a small village in Norway, where the night sky stretched endlessly over frozen lakes and snow-laden pines. Wrapped in layers, she ventured out on the first clear night, her breath a mist in the air.

Hours passed, and doubt crept in. Perhaps this would be another disappointment, another dream left just out of reach. Then, just as she turned to leave, the sky flickered. A green ribbon of light unfurled across the heavens, followed by waves of violet and blue. It was as if the stars themselves had come alive, dancing just for her.

Tears stung her eyes—not from the cold, but from the overwhelming beauty. In that moment, Lena knew dreams weren’t meant to fade. Sometimes, they simply waited for the right time to come true.
